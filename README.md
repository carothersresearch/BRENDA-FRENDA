# BRENDA-FRENDA
Given a list of EC numbers, parses through BRENDA to generate a spreadsheet of relevant reaction data ready to feed into ODBM.

## Setup

Due to licensing issues, BRENDA is not able to be downloaded directly by this program, so you are asked to download it as a text file [here](https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/download.php). Convert it to a txt file:

```sh
tar -xf FILE_NAME.txt.tar.gz
```

will need to add more for dependencies later
